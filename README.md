# Nextjs_learning

- react js build js file and give them to browser - so client side render will happen
- next js - during the building , fetched data and creates Html and Css file 
 - we can deploy html and css file 
 - data is prefetched so user can see instantly data

features nextjs- 
 - get static props
 - get static path
 - dynamic route
 - static route
 - server side rendring 
 - client side rendring

- next js 12 uses Rust bundler
- react js uses webpack bundler - it is slow

# Start
 - npx create-next-app@latest
