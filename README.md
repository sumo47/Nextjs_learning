    - if we will disable javascript into browser then all content will disappeare
  - next.js = it send html and css file to browser (server render)
    - if we will disable javascript into browser then nothing will happen

- next js uses Turbopack bundler
- Routing - 
  - we use folder to route page 
  - use page.js file name inside folder

     - localhost:3000/services = services/page
- Nested Routing
  - use folder inside folder and page.js inside it
  - localhost:3000/services/seo = services/seo/page.js
